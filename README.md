Go Deck Builder is a project I created to accomplish two things, learn Golang and create a webserver that builds Magic
the Gathering decks.

## Architecture
The Go Deck Builder integrates with the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api), and uses this tool to build a deck for a user based on their
specified parameters.

## Local Development
1. Install Go locally, you can visit the official [Go downloads](https://golang.org/dl/) page to do that.
